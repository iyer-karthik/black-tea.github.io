Inverse problems is a field of study dealing with inversion of models or data. An inverse problem is a mathematical framework that is used to obtain information about a physical object or system from observed measurements. The solution to this problem is useful because it generally provides information about a physical parameter that we cannot directly observe. Applications of inverse problems can be found in medical imaging, geophysics, computer vision, astronomy, nondestructive testing, and many others.

A typical inverse problem is to recover the coefficients of a partial differential equation (PDE) i.e. physical properties like medium propagation, internal density distribution, etc from measurements on the boundary of the domain. My research was on unique recovery of coefficients in an elliptic PDE defined on a bounded domain from the knowledge of boundary measurements which are encoded through the so-called Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DN) operator. The main emphasis of my research was on the the unique recovery of coefficients for two different families of elliptic PDEs under low regularity or degeneracy of the coefficients which can be formulated mathematically as
a question on the injectivity of the DN operator.

### Notes 
Haberman and Tataru in 2011 gave a proof on uniqueness in the inverse coductivity problem for less regular conductivities. Their paper got me interested in uniqueness aspects for inverse problems in presence of rough coefficients. To understand their proof and teach myself the techniques, I wrote an [exposition](documents/HT_uniqueness_exposition.pdf) explaining in detail the key ideas in their argument.
