## Welcome!

My name is Karthik Iyer and I currently work as a Data Scientist at [Vanguard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vanguard_Group) in Client Experience Enablement. Prior to joining Vanguard I was a Data Science fellow at [Insight Data Science](https://www.insightdatascience.com/) in NYC where I worked on providing actionable insights to increase investor returns on peer-to-peer lending platforms. Before that, I completed my doctorate in Mathematics at the University of Washington. My broad area of research was inverse problems arising in partial differential equations.  

I always have a few side-projects going on. Please take a look at my [github](https://github.com/iyer-karthik) for my projects. If you feel like collaborating feel free to connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iyer-karthik/) or reach out to me at <karthik2@gmx.com>
