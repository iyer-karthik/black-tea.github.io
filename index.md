## Welcome!

My name is Karthik Iyer and I currently work as a Data Scientist at [Vanguard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vanguard_Group) - an investment management company. Prior to joining Vanguard, I completed my doctorate in mathematics at the University of Washington where I worked on inverse problems arising in partial differential equations.  In my spare time I can be usually found reading, running and drinking copious amounts of coffee. 

I maintain an online presence on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iyer-karthik/) and [github](https://github.com/iyer-karthik). Feel free to connect or reach out to me at <karthik2@gmx.com>
