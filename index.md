## Welcome!

My name is Karthik Iyer and I currently work as a Data Scientist at [Vanguard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vanguard_Group) in Client Experience Enablement. I was previously a Data Science fellow at [Insight Data Science](https://www.insightdatascience.com/) in NYC and worked on providing actionable insights to increase investor returns on peer-to-peer lending platforms. Before that, I completed my doctorate in Mathematics at the University of Washington. My broad area of research was inverse problems arising in partial differential equations.
