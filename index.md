## Welcome!

I am a currently a Data Science fellow at [Insight Data Science](https://www.insightdatascience.com/) in NYC. I recently graduated with a PhD in Mathematics from University of Washington, Seattle. My thesis supervisor was [Gunther Uhlmann](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~gunther/). My broad area of research was inverse problems arising in partial differential equations.  

Before joining the PhD program, I studied at [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](https://www.math.tifrbng.res.in/)  where I graduated with a MSc degree in Mathematics. Prior to that, I did my undergraduate studies from [University of Mumbai](http://www.mu.ac.in/) where I obtained a BSc degree in Mathematics. 

I love solving problems using data science techniques. Please take a look at my [github](https://github.com/iyer-karthik) for my projects. I can be reached at <karthik2@gmx.com>
